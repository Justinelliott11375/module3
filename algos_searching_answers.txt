Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Looking for a specific poster in a display book of posters, the list is unordered so you have to look at each page until you find the one you're looking for.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Finding a book in a library, knowing the book's call number, you can walk past aisles to eliminate them, then rows, then individual books, constantly dividing and eliminating parts of the list until the book is found.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A binary search would be much faster, but can't be used on an unsorted list so a linear search would have to be used.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A binary search's logarithmic time complexity would be much more efficient than a linear searches linear time complexity, especially in a large list of one million items.

Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findAlbatross(dictionary, word){
  var low = 0;
  var high = dictionary.length - 1;
  while(low <= high){
    var mid = Math.floor((low + high)/2)
    if(dictionary[mid] > word){
      high = mid - 1;
    }
    else if(dictionary[mid] < word){
      low = mid + 1;
    }
    else {
      return(word + " is at index " + mid);
    }
  }
}


var myList = ["Aardvark", "Abstract", "Albatross", "Alchemist", "Baseball", "Bat", "Boomerang", "Caller", "Cocoon", "Hamster", "Jackalope", "Toothbrush", "Yoyo", "Zebra"];

findAlbatross(myList, "Albatross");

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findSpottedFish(fishTank){
  for(let i = 0; i < fishTank.length; i++){
    if(fishTank[i].hasSpots === true){
      return("found! index " + i + " is a white-spotted goldfish!");
    }
    console.log("not at index " + i)
  }
}

function nonSpottedFish(){
  this.hasSpots = false;
}

function spottedFish(){
  this.hasSpots = true;
}

fish1 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish3 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish12 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish4 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish7 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish8 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish2  = new nonSpottedFish();
fish9 = new spottedFish();
fish5 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish11 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish6 = new nonSpottedFish();
fish10 = new nonSpottedFish();

myFishTank = [fish7, fish4, fish8, fish3, fish12, fish10, fish9, fish5, fish2, fish1];

findSpottedFish(myFishTank);
