Exercises

1. What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

Stacks handle the most recent object first, queues handle the first object to arrive(the one that has been there the longest) first

2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

Both are linear, list-type data structures that use one method for adding data to the list and one method for removing it.

3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

stacks, the most recent action would be the one that needed to be undone/redone, and further undo's or redo's would need to occur order continuing from the most recent

Programming Questions

You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

Pseudocode:

FUNCTION reverseString(originalString)
  CREATE a new stack
  FOR each character in originalString
    CALL stack.push WITH character
  END FOR
  CREATE empty string to STORE reversedString
  WHILE stack is not empty
    CALL stack.pop RETURNING character
    APPEND character to reversed
  END WHILE
  RETURN reversed
END FUNCTION

Python:

def reverseString(string):
  tempStack= []
  for i in string:
    tempStack.append(i)
  reversedString = ''
  while len(tempStack) > 0:
    reversedString += tempStack.pop()
  return reversedString

Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.

CLASS Stack
  FUNCTION pop(queue)
    FOR each item in queue
      IF item is last element in queue
        DELETE and RETURN item
      ELSE
        APPEND item to newQueue
  END FUNCTION
END CLASS

3. Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).

CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   APPEND element to the end of the list
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   REMOVE and RETURN element at beginning of the list
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
