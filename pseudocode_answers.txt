Short Answer:

1. Psuedocode is more similar to plain English so it is typically easier to read and understand big picture concepts without being distracted by syntax. Pseudocode is not directly related to any single programming language so it can be written and understood by teams or individuals regardless of what language(s) they know. Being more similar to plain English, pseudocode can be more easily read and comprehended by people that are not programmers.

2. Pseudocode is not recognized by any IDE, console, or command line so it would only return errors.
